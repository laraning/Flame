## About Flame

Laraning Flame is a Feature Development-driven framework that will improve the way you structure and develop your application features.

If you use this package you will:
* Create your features in a standard code-convention way.
* Create and re-use graphical components (called Twinkles) that will make you improve your layout code structure.
* Be able to execute Controller actions inside Twinkles prior to the view rendering.
* Structure your application as feature modules, having a much better code read, strucuture and reusability!
